## Overview

As part of my minor project, I worked with my team to create a laptop recommendation and comparison platform. The project aimed to provide users with a seamless experience in selecting and comparing laptops based on specifications, features, and pricing. We initially considered building a full-stack application but later decided to focus on front-end development and UI design for a more streamlined user experience.

## Key Features

- **Laptop Comparison:** Users can select multiple laptops and compare their specifications side by side in a visually organized format.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured the platform works seamlessly across different screen sizes, improving accessibility.
- **Interactive UI Components:** Developed reusable components for displaying laptop details, comparisons, and recommendations efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** For building the interactive front-end.
- **Figma:** For designing and prototyping the UI/UX.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
- **V0 by Vercel:** For converting design into code seamlessly.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was ensuring that the UI remained clean and intuitive while handling large amounts of data. We tackled this by structuring components efficiently and maintaining a visually balanced design. Additionally, collaborating effectively within the team and aligning design with functionality was a valuable learning experience.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a well-structured and visually appealing laptop recommendation and comparison platform. It allows users to make informed decisions effortlessly. This project strengthened my front-end development skills and deepened my understanding of UI/UX principles in a practical setting.
